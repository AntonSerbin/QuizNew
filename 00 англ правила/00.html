       <br>
       <p> This Quiz can be played with one or more teams. Recomended two teams and bigger.</p>
        <p>The recommended number of participants in the team is 3-4 people. It is also necessary to choose a responsable person who will switch tasks and check answers. This person can play all tasks as usual players. </p>
       	<p>After the teams are formed, each team will need a form for answers (a regular piece of paper will be enough).</p>
       	<p>Before the start of each level, there will be local rules that explain what players need to do. </p>
        <p>After the end of the level, the responsible person collects the forms with the answers and checks the number of correct answers.</p>
       	<p>Spelling errors and inaccuracies of answers are allowed. The difference in the format of answers is not allowed (for example, at the level there was a ANSWER FORMAT - AUTHOR'S NAME, and the players indicated the NAME of the work in the form).
        <p>For each correct answer, the team gets one ball.</p>
      	<p>At the end of each level, the responsible person records and announces the current results of the game. </p>
      	<p>The winner is the team that scores more points for all levels.</p>
